  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GENERAL INFORMATION
          - Within the following directory, all necessary materials needed for replicating our published elementary effects results can be found
          - It is important to note that these materials have been compiled for reproducibility, not adaptability. If adaptability is desired, input datasets must be
            formatted exactly the same as the datasets provided in these supplementary materials (~/elementary effects/inputs/testdesign.xlsx).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FILE STUCTURE
          - All executable files are located in the main elementary effects root directory (~"/elementary effects/") and are numerically labeled in the order in which
            they must be executed. In other words, in order to reproduce the same results, one must first run the "1.studydesign.R", followed by
            "2.Study77 EE analysis.R".
          - Aside for the executable R files and the README.txt, all inputs, outputs, and source code that are referenced or generated in the executable code are
            stored within their own subdirectories. The subdirectories are as follows:
                Source Code: "~/elementary effects/source_code/"
                Outputs: "~/elementary effects/outputs/"
                Inputs: "~/elementary effects/inputs/"
          - Upon download, the outputs subdirectory is empty, and only when the executable code is run, will files begin to populate this directory.
          - Furthermore, the authors have provided their output files as a reference source to ensure that user generated outputs align with the authors' published
            results. These example output files are located in the "~/elementary effects/example_outputs/" subdirectory.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EXECUTABLE CODE
          - There are two executable scripts located within the root folder ("~/elementary effects/")--namely, 1) study design, and 2) elementary effects analysis.
          - There is a clear sequence in which these executable scripts should be executed, whereby each script is prefaced with a numeric label indicating the
            execution order.
          - All referenced source code, inputs, and outputs utilized by the executable code are all stored within their unique subdirectories.
          - Detailed below are the specifics related to each executable:

                  1. Study Design
                      File Path:  "~/elementary effects/1.studydesign.R"
                      Description:  This code generates the model design and the BSM inputs used for Study 75, Q4 FY 15 sensitivity study.
                      Inputs: There is only 1 input:
                              1. "~/inputs/testdesign.xlsx"
                                  Note: To replicate this study with different input data, the desired input data must be formatted in the same way as the
                                        testdesign.xlsx file
                      Outputs:  There are four file outputs, but only two general types of outputs--1) the model design, and 2) BSM inputs:
                              1) the model design
                                  1. design.Rdata -- The statistical model design
                              2) the BSM inputs - Saved to 3 different file formats
                                  2. SS_inputs.txt -- BSM inputs, txt format
                                  3. SS_inputs.csv -- BSM inputs, csv format
                                  4. Study77design.RData -- BSM inputs, RData format
                              All outputs are saved to the "~/outputs/" directory
                      Source Code:  None
                      Author & Date: Danny Inman, June 2 2015
                      Other Information:  In order to reproduce the same results, adjust the paths of the working directory and R library.

                  2. Elementary Effects Analysis
                        File Path:  "~/elementary effects/1.Study 77 EE Analysis.R"
                        Description:  This code takes the outputs from the BSM and the statistical design and runs the elementary effects analysis.We used elementary effects
					as a filter from which we selected model factors to be passed on to the total effects analysis.
                                      1) EE was performed on biofuel production in 2030: total biofuel production, cellulosic ethanol production, and biomass-based hydocarbon production.
                                      2) I removed the upper settings for the policy durations (12, 16, 20yrs) and then reran the EE as listed in item (1)
                                      3) EE was performed for maximum biofuel production for total, etoh, and hc
                                      4) see point 2 above, applied to 3
                        Inputs:  There are three inputs:
                                    1. "~/inputs/testdesign.xlsx" -- This spreadsheet has the model factors and ranges for the BSM. It is used in both the EE and TE study design.
                                    2. "~/outputs/design.xlsx" -- This is the morris study design generated in 1.studydesign.R
                                    3. "~/inputs/study77out" -- This is the output from the BSM Model run (ran indepently from R) 
                        Outputs:  Statistical outputs for the Elementary Effects Analysis are saved to "~/elementary effects/outputs" directory
                                There are 9 total output files generated:
                                    1. vars.RData -- list of variables from "/inputs/testdesign.xlsx"
