Markets are very local
When it comes to manure, you can get 2-3% solids to very solid material
 - Dairy and swine operations are very watery
 - Beef operations - dry in west, wetter in east
 - poultry is litter

If you have to truck it more that 50-100 miles, it's not an economically viable solution

Chesapeake Bay has a lot of poultry manure excess - trying to come up with byproducts for waste

For the majority of the midwest, in general I don't think there's a shortage of land for land application - lots of grain and wheat - different in Carolinas, Chesapeake, and CA

Is there a close enough local market that a producer could tap into?

I have heard of producers paying someone to take manure but not common

Local markets - there are brokerages (OK - for poultry litter set up by university) - can enter if you have litter available or if you need it.

In WI, there are community digesters

Concentration of feedlots in west - they're taking beef manure and mixing it with poultry and composting it and bagging it for sales

Dairy - one challenge is the type of bedding material (many times sand) - can plug up a pl if trying to pump waste; if you want to separate the solids, it can be very hard on 
mechanical separaters.

On farm income has dropped significantly (50%) over the past few years.

look at WI, WA, CA

NRCS - 2004 may have had costs - focused on AD but will have data and info on transportation challenge.
